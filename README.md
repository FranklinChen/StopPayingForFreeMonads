# Stop paying for free monads
Haskell code for YOW LambdaJam 2016 workshop

We'll build up an implementation of a free monad over a coproduct of functors, following Wouter Swierstra's "Datatypes Ã  la Carte".

We'll create a couple of languages and interpreters, and run programs using these languages.

We then do the same in the "final" style advocated by Oleg Kiselyov in "Typed Tagless Final Interpreters".
